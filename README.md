# Project Omnilyth

A Path of Exile toolkit — crafting calculators, regex generators, atlas tree planner, leveling tools, and more. **Supports both PoE 1 and PoE 2** (dual-game shell, in-progress for PoE 2 0.5 launch on 2026-05-29).

## Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19 + Vite 7 + Tailwind CSS 4
- **Routing**: React Router v7 (lazy-loaded modules)
- **State**: Context API (league, prices, pinning, leveling, atlas tree)

## ⚠️ Currently Disabled

- **Timeless Jewel Calculator** — code is still in the repo (`src/calculators/timelessJewel.js`, `src/pages/TimelessJewelPage.jsx`, `src/workers/timelessSearch.js`, `src/data/timeless/`) but the registry entry is commented out, so the calculator is NOT shipped in the deployed bundle. Reason: the seed-search algorithm is ported from [vilsol/timeless-jewels](https://github.com/vilsol/timeless-jewels) (GPL-3.0), and GPL-3.0 requires source-availability for the combined work. The Omnilyth source repo is currently private — distributing the bundle without source isn't compliant. Re-enabling requires a licensing decision (flip source public, replace with permissive port, or remove permanently). See `CLAUDE.md` §6.5 for context.

## What's Left to Do

### High Priority
- [ ] **Mobile Filter Modal** — full-screen filter panel for mobile gem browser
- [ ] **Acts 5-10 Data** — complete gem availability for remaining acts
- [ ] **Performance Profiling** — optimize large data rendering

### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Gem Favorites** — bookmark/favorite gems for quick access
- [ ] **Export Gem Lists** — copy gem lists to clipboard
- [ ] **Error Boundaries** — graceful error handling for components

### Planned Features
- [ ] **Passive Planner** — skill tree passive planning tool
- [ ] **Stash Valuation** — estimate stash tab value using poe.ninja prices
- [ ] **Seed Finder** — timeless jewel seed optimization
- [ ] **PoE 2 dual-game shell** — GameContext + registry filter + topbar switcher + PoE 2 stub home (Phase 1 in progress; target 2026-05-07)
- [ ] **PoE 2 Item Mod Regex** — fork of `item-regex` with poe2db.tw mod data (Phase 3, ships post-0.5 launch on 2026-05-29)
- [ ] **PoE 2 Gem Browser** — fork of `leveling-gems` with PoE 2 gem system (uncut/skill/spirit/support/meta gems)
- [ ] **PoE 2 Atlas Tree Planner** — Phase 4, ships once 0.5 atlas tree expansion (~40+ nodes) lands and community data extraction stabilizes

### Long Term
- [ ] **TypeScript Migration** — add type safety progressively
- [ ] **User Accounts** — save progress across devices
- [ ] **PWA Support** — offline access and install prompt
